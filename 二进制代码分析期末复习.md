# Chapter 1 Basic static techniques

## PE

The Portable Executable file format is used by:

* Winodws executables
* object code
* DLL

It contains the information necessary for OS loader to manage the wrapped executable code.

PE file starts with PE header, followed by a series of sections.

* `.text`<br />All code stores in this section.<br />
    The only section that can execute.
* `.rdata`<br />Holds read-only data that is globally accessible within the program.
* `.data`<br />Global variables
* `.rsrc`<br />Resources such as images, audios.

## PE header

* type of application
* required library functions
* space requirements
* dynamically linked libraries
* imported functions
* exported functions
* time date stamp
* name of sections and their sizes
* subsystem
* resources

## Linking

### Static linking

Rarely use.

__All code from that library is copied into the executable__.

Can't differentiate between statically linked code and the executable's own code.

Link in compile time.

PE header doesn't deal with statically linked library.

### Runtime linking

Commonly use, especially in packed or obfuscated malware.

__Executables connect to libraries only when that function is needed__, not at program start.

Link in run time.

Can use `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress` to access any function in any library on the system.

PE header doesn't deal with runtime linked library.

### Dynamic Linking

Most commonly use.

__The host OS searches for the necessary libraries when the program is loaded__.

PE header stores information about every library that will be loaded and every function that will be used by the program.

# Chapter 2 Malware analysis in virtual machines

## Virtual machine

A guest OS is installed within the host OS on a virtual machine, and the OS running in the virtual machine is kept isolated from the host OS.

## Network configuration

### Disconnect

### Host-only networking

Create a separate LAN between the host OS and the guest OS, which is not connected to the Internet.

### Custom networking

Multiple virtual machines linked by a LAN but disconnected from the Internet and the host machine.

# Chapter 3 Basic dynamic analysis

## Dynamic analysis tools

### Malware sandbox

A security mechanism for running untrusted programs in a safe environment without fear of harming real systems.

#### Drawbacks

* Can't use command-line options.
* Doesn't have a command-and-control channel
* May not record all events
* Malware may detect when it is running in a virtual machine
* Some malware requires the presence of cetain registry keys or files on the system
* DLL malware's exported functions will not be invoked properly
* Sandbox environment may not be correct for the malware
* A sandbox cannot tell you what the malware does.

### Procmon

An advanced monitoring tool for Windows that provides a way to monitor certain registry, file system, network, process and thread activity.

### Regshot

Allow you to take and compare two registry snapshots.

### Netcat

Used over both inbound and outbound connections for port scanning, tunneling, proxying, prot forwarding, and much more.

Command-line options:

* `-l`: listen
* `-p`: with a port number, specifies the port on which to listen

### Wireshark

A packet capture tool that intercepts and logs network traffic.

## Basic dynamic tools in practice

1. Running procmon and setting a filter on the malware executable name and clearing out all events just before running.
2. Starting Process Explorer.
3. Gathering a first snapshot of the registry using Regshot.
4. Setting up your virtual network using INetSim and ApateDNS.
5. Setting up network traffic logging using Wireshark.

# Chapter 4 A crash course in x86 disassembly

## X86 architecture

### Main memory

The main memory __for a single program__ can be divied into (from high memory address to low):

* Data<br />All global variables are in this section.
* Code
* Heap<br />dynamically allocated space
* Stack<br />local variables

### Instructions

```assembly
mov ecx 0x42
```

* instruction: `mov ecx 0x42`
* mnemonic: `mov`
* operands: `ecx`, `0x42`
* destination operand: `ecx`
* source operand: `0x42`
* __opcode__: `mov ecx`, `0x42`

endianess: little-endian, the most significant byte is ordered at smallest address

### Register

* general register<br />EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EBP, ESP, ESI<br />32 bits in size
* segment register
* status register
* instruction pointer<br />EIP<br />stores the memory address of __next__ insturction to be executed
* __Float values are stored in x87 registers__

### Simple instructions

#### `add`

`add eax ebx` adds EBX to EAX and stores the result in EAX

#### `sub`

`sub eax ebx` subtracts EBX from EAX

#### `mul`

`mul 0x50` multiplies EAX by 0x50 and stores the result in EDX:EAX

#### `div`

`div 0x75` divides EDX:EAX by 0x75 and stores the result in EAX and the remainder in EDX

#### `test`

`test dst src` has same effect as `and dst src`. To test if EAX is zero, use `test eax eax`

#### `cmp`

| `cmp dst src` | ZF   | CF   |
| :-----------: | ---- | ---- |
|   dst = src   | 1    | 0    |
|   dst < src   | 0    | 1    |
|   dst > src   | 0    | 0    |

Same effect as `sub dst src`.

### Function calls

1. arguments are placed on the stack in reverse order using `push` insturctions
2. A function is called using `call`, which causes the current instruction address stored in EIP register to be pushed onto stack, and EIP is set to the function address
3. `push ebp`
4. `mov ebp esp`
5. `sub` ESP for reseving space for local variables
6. do function things
7. `mov esp ebp`
8. `pop ebp`
9. `ret`

`enter` is 3, 4, 5; `leave` is 7, 8, 9

### calling convention

* arguments are placed on the stack in reverse order, and in the function stack, arguments are above EBP, positive offset
* local variables are reserved in the begining, and are below EBP, negative offset
* return value is using EAX, float values using x87

# Chapter 6 Recognizing C code constructs in assembly

## Loop

compared to `for`-loop, `while`-loop lacks an increment section

## Switch

For three or less branches, use `if` style; for four or more branches, use jump table

## Struct

Alignment

# Chapter 7 Analyzing malicious Windows programs

## Windows API

* `WORD`<br />16 bit unsigned value
* `DWORD`<br />32 bit unsigend value

## Special files

Shared files are files with names that start with `\\serverName\share` or `\\?\serverName\share`.

Win32 device namespace has prefix `\\.\`.

## Registry

### Root keys

* `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` (`HKLM`)
* `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` (`HKCU`)
* `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`
* `HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG`
* `HKEY_USERS`

### Automatically run programs

Write entries to the `Run` subkey

### Registry functions

* `RegOpenKeyEx`
* `RegSetValueEx`
* `RegGetValue`

## Network API

* `socket`<br />Creates a socket
* `bind`<br />Attaches a socket to a particular port, prior to the `accept` call
* `listen`<br />Indicates that a socket will be listening for incoming connections
* `accept`<br />Opens a connection to a remote socket and accepts the connection
* `connect`<br />Opens a connection to a remote socket; the remote socket must be waiting for the connection
* `recv`<br />Recieves data from the remote socket
* `send`<br />Sends data to the remote socket

## Thread

Threads within a process all share the same memory space, but each has its own processor registers and stack.

## Service

Windows allows tasks to run without their own processes or threads by using services that run as background applications; code is scheduled and run by the Windows service manager without user input.

## Native API

The `ntdll` functions use APIs and structures just like the ones used in the kernel. These functions make up the Native API.

# Chapter 8 Debugging

## Step over

When stepping-over `call` instructions, you bypass them.

## Step into

When stepping-into `call` instructions, the next instruction in the debugger is the first instruction of the called function.

## Breakpoints

### Software execution breakpoints

Overwriting the first byte of an instruction with `0xCC`, the instruction for `int 3`, the breakpoint interrupt designed for use the debuggers.

#### Conditional breakpoints

The debugger evaluates the condition, and if the condition is not met, it automatically continues execution without alerting the user.

### Hardware execution breakpoints

Using dedicated hardware registers. Can break on access rather than on execution.

Only four hardware registers store breakpoint addresses.

# Chapter 9 Ollydbg

All PE files have a preferred base address, known as image base.

If two DLLs are loaded, and the both have the preferred load address, then Windows will load one of the DLLs at that address, and then __relocate__ the other DLL somewhere else.

# Chapter 11 Malware behavior

## Reverse shell

A reverse shell is a connection that originates from an infected machine and provides attackers shell access to that machine.

## Keylogger

When keylogging, malware records keystrokes.

### Kernel-based keylogger

A part of Rootkit

### User-space keylogger

Implemented with hooking (`SetWindowsHookEx`) or polling (`GetAsyncKeyState` and `GetForegroundWindow`).

## Persistence mechanism

### Modiciation of the system's registry

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

### Trojanizing system binaries

Patches bytes of a system binary to force the system to execute the malware the next time the infected binary is run or loaded.

### DLL load-order attack

# Chapter 12 Convert malware launching

## Process injection

This technique injects code into another running process, and that process unwittingly executes the malicious code.

### DLL injection

DLL injection works by injecting code into a remote process that calls `LoadLibrary`.

The function `CreateRemoteThread` is commonly used for DLL injection.

## Process replacement

Overwrite the memory space of a running process with a malicious executable.

Key: 

1. Create a process in a suspended state. 
2. Use `ZwUnmapViewOfSection` to release all memory pointed to by a section passed as a parameter.
3. Perform `VirtualAllocEx` to allocate new memory for the malware
4. Use `WriteProcessMemory` to write each of the malware sections to the victim process space
5. Call `SetThreadContext` to set the entry point to point to the malicious code
6. Call `ResumeThread` to initiate the malware

## Detours

Perform import table modification, attach DLLs to eisting program files, and add function hooks to running processes.

# Chapter 13 Data encoding

## XOR

Use a static byte value and modifies each byte of plaintext by performing a logical XOR operation with that value.

### NULL-preserving signle-byte XOR encoding scheme

XOR except NULL or the key itself

## Base64

3 bytes plaintext --> 4 bytes cipher, with each 6 bits plaintext and 2 zero padding in the header

__If a string ends with "=", it is very like to be encoed by base64__.
